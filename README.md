## 👋 Hi there, I'm Ole

I create projects with soft- and hardware, here mostly just for fun!

--

- ⚙️ I use mostly `.py` `.ts` `.c` `.kicad_*` ~~`.DS_Store`~~ <sub>ah damn, add it to the gitignore..</sub>
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [µURU](https://github.com/olell/uURU)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create a good profile README on github
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

--
I guess everyone should read [this](https://asahilinux.org/docs/project/policies/slop/) :)
